/**
 * Priority Scheduling Algorithm (Planned Implementation)
 *
 * This file is added as part of future expansion of the simulator.
 * The full implementation will be added in the next version.
 *
 * Priority Scheduling works by selecting the process with the highest priority.
 * Lower priority number indicates higher priority.
 *
 * Steps (to be implemented):
 * 1. Sort processes based on priority.
 * 2. Break ties using arrival time.
 * 3. Generate Gantt chart order.
 * 4. Compute waiting and turnaround times.
